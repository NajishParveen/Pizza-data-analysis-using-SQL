## 🍕 Pizza Data Analysis using MySQL

This project focuses on analyzing a pizza sales dataset using MySQL to derive meaningful business insights. It showcases how SQL can be used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis in a real-world food and beverage business scenario.

### 📊 Project Overview

Using structured query language (SQL), this analysis explores key business metrics such as total revenue, average order value, top-selling pizza types, and peak ordering times. The dataset includes order details, pizza types, order dates, and prices.

The analysis answers important business questions like:

* What are the top 5 best-selling pizzas by quantity and revenue?
* What is the busiest time of day for orders?
* Which days of the week see the highest sales?
* What is the average number of pizzas sold per order?

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* MySQL (for querying and analysis)
* SQL joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions
* Data visualization tools (optional: Power BI, Tableau, or Excel)

### 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is fictional but structured realistically, with multiple relational tables.
